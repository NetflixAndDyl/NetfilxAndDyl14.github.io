Bio:
<P>
A little bit about my self is, I am 19 and I really love sports I have played football since I was 11
I also went to two National Championships in pop warner for football. I played through out
high school, now I am trying to play in college. In school I have always been somewhat of an above average 
student maintaining a 3.6 GPA in high school. I may not be the best student but I always try my hardest 
and give it my best in not just school but in anything I do.
